## Prerequisites

To run ToK, you'll need to install two dependencies:

- **[Neo4j Desktop](https://neo4j.com/download/):** Used for top-tier vector and graph stores.
- **[Ollama](https://ollama.com/download):** Facilitates easy model downloading, serving, and intelligent device loading.

### Setting Up Neo4j

1. Download and install *Neo4j Desktop*.
2. Add the **Neo4j bin path** to your system's **PATH** environment variable. This allows Neo4j to be accessed by ToK.
   - Example bin path for Windows: `\path\to\user\.Neo4jDesktop\relate-data\dbmss\your-current-dbms\bin`

- (For Windows) Activate the Neo4j CLI by running the following command in Command Prompt or PowerShell for Windows:

   ```bash
   neo4j windows-service install
   ```

> Please go through [this link](https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/installation/) to perform the above steps for other arch's (and for reference).

## Getting Started

1. Visit the [Releases](https://github.com/gurveervirk/ToK/releases) page and download the latest `ToK.exe` to a location/directory (app creates necessary files and folders for correct working).
2. Modify the settings by running the app once and clicking the settings icon at the top right hand corner:
   - **username:** Replace with your Neo4j database username.
   - **password:** Replace with the password you set in your Neo4j project.
   - **uri:** Replace with your Neo4j project's URI.


   > **Note:** The default username and URI are the default values for a Neo4j DB.
   > You can also modify it in `settings.json`, created by the app.

**Done!** You're now ready to start using ToK.

## Usage

After completing the setup:

1. Launch ToK from the desktop or start menu.
2. Choose to either chat directly with the bot or upload documents using the top-right button for enhanced query responses.
3. Enjoy the seamless experience of interacting with a locally-run, AI-powered knowledge assistant that keeps your data private and secure.
